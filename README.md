# 2024-12-20-TIC-TAC-TOE


## Project Overview  
This project is a **Tic Tac Toe** game üéÆ built with React. The application allows users to play in two modes:
- In **Play with a Friend Mode**, two users can take turns playing on the same device. 
- In **Play with a Robot Mode**, one player can challenge the AI, where the robot makes its moves automatically.

The game features a reset button to restart the game and displays the winner üèÜ when a player achieves a winning combination. Additionally, if no player wins and all spaces are filled, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

### Gameplay  
- **Play with a Friend Mode**: Players take turns making moves against each other.
- **Play with a Robot Mode**: Players can play against an AI robot, which automatically makes its moves.

### User Interface  
- Displays the current player's turn.
- Highlight the winner or draw when the game is over.
- A "Reset Game" button to restart the game.
- Two game boards are available:
- **Play with a Friend Mode**: A board for 2-player gameplay.
- **Play with a Robot Mode**: A board for playing against the robot.

### AI in Play with a Robot Mode
- The robot makes simple moves based on an algorithm, taking turns against the player.
- The robot's moves are implemented with basic AI logic. (Future improvements will focus on enhancing the AI's strategy.)

### Testing  
The application is covered by Cypress end-to-end tests to ensure:
- The board displays correctly.
- Players can alternate turns.
- The winner is declared correctly.
- The reset functionality works as expected.

**üìåAll tests are located in the `cypress/e2e` folder.**
